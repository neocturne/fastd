libmnl ( https://www.netfilter.org/projects/libmnl/ )

The files in src/dep/libmnl were taken from libmnl 1.0.5 without changes, with
the exception of internal.h, which was replaced with a fastd-specific file.
libmnl is relased under LGPLv2.1+, which can be found in src/dep/libmnl/COYPING.

The embedded version of libmnl is used only when the `offload_l2tp' and
`libmnl_builtin' build flags are enabled. The default behaviour is to link
to a libmnl found in the build sysroot, usually dynamically.
