# fastd - Fast and Secure Tunneling Daemon

fastd is a very small VPN daemon which tunnels IP packets and Ethernet frames
over UDP. It supports various modern encryption and authentication schemes and
can be used in many different network topologies (1:1, 1:n, meshed).

fastd runs on Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD and macOS. Android support exists in the
code, but is currently unmaintained. Binary packages are provided by many major
Linux distributions.

For more information, see the [documentation](https://fastd.readthedocs.io/) and
