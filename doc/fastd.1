.TP
\fB\-\-hide\-ip\-addresses\fR
Hides IP addresses in log output.
.TP
\fB\-\-hide\-mac\-addresses\fR
Hides MAC addresses in log output.
.TP
\fB\-\-mode\fR, \fB\-m\fR tap|multitap|tun
Sets the mode of the interface; default is TAP mode.
.TP
\fB\-\-interface\fR, \fB\-i\fR <name>
Sets the name of the TUN/TAP interface to use. If not specified, default names specified by the system will be used.
.TP

.TP
\fB\-\-bind\fR, \fB\-b\fR <address>[:<port>]
Sets the bind address. Address can be an IPv4 address or an IPv6 address, or the keyword any. IPv6 addresses must be put in square brackets.
